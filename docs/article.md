## Mongo2Arango

**mongo2arango** is tool to copy data from a MongoDB collection to an ArangoDB collection.
This is very useful when you to migrate your data from a database to another one, or you just want to populate data in ArangoDB to take advantages of such a database.

The application will process the data in the following way :
* the data are read from MongoDB : in addition to the collection, a query and a projection can be provided to select the data and the fields to write in ArangoDB.
* then inserted in ArangoDB: the tool uses the batch mode, i.e. new document creations are stacked until a limit size, then all these stacked requests are sent to ArangoDB
Processing will loop through these steps until there are no more data to read.

As it it a Java application, it will run wherever you want. For launching, use the following command : java -jar mongo2arango-jar-with-dependencies.jar -c mongo2arango.properties.

The only argument is a properties file that you need to provide to the application.
The supported properties are:
